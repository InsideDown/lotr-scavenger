Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better leave Bag End soon, and get out of the Shire before the end of July at latest. I will return as soon as I can; and I will follow you, if I find that you are gone. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through Bree. You can trust the landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend of mine on the Road: a Man, lean, tall, bearing a broadsword and going by the name Strider. He knows our business and will help you. Make for Rivendell. There I hope we may meet again. If I do not come, Elrond will 
advise you.</p><hr />
